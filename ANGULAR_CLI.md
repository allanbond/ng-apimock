# Using ng-apimock with angular-cli

In order to use ng-apimock you need to do 3 things:
1. install ng-apimock
2. serve the mocks
3. proxy the api requests to served mocks
4. update your npm start script
 
## 1. Install ng-apimock
 
Using npm
 ```javascript
npm install --save-dev ng-apimock
```

Using yarn
```javascript
yarn add ng-apimock --dev
```
 
## 2. Serve the mocks
In order to serve the mocks using ng-apimock you need to start an express server.
Express is already available as it is a dependency of angular-cli / webpack-dev-server.

Create a **server.js** file and copy paste the snippet below:
 ```javascript
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const ngApimock = require('ng-apimock')();
const app = express();

/**
 * Register all available mocks and generate interface
 */
ngApimock.run({
    "src": "mocks",
    "outputDir": ".tmp/ngApimock",
    "done": function() {}
});

app.set('port', (process.env.PORT || 3000));
// process the api calls through ng-apimock
app.use(require('ng-apimock/lib/utils').ngApimockRequest);
// serve the mocking interface for local development
app.use('/mocking', express.static('.tmp/ngApimock'));

app.listen(app.get('port'), function() {
  console.log('app running on port', app.get('port'));
});
```

## 3. Proxy the requests
In order to proxy the requests for the api and /mocking interface you need to create a proxy file.

Create a **proxy.config.json** file and copy paste the snippet below:
 ```json
 {
  "/api/*": {
    "target": "http://localhost:3000",
    "secure": false,
    "logLevel": "debug"
  }
 }
 ```
 
*** NOTE: `/api/*` is a common naming convention for REST endpoints, including ng-mockapi's own endpoints. If your app's endpoints use a different naming scheme, be sure to add *new* entries rather than changing this one. Otherwise, ng-mockapi admin requests, like `ngMockapi.selectScenario()`, won't work.

## 4. Update your npm start script
We need to let ng-serve know that it should use the proxy config. Therefore in package.json the following line:
 ```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "ng serve"
}
 ```
needs to be changed to
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "ng serve --proxy-config proxy.config.json"
}
```
 
 
Your mocks are now proxied to http://localhost:3000.
The web interface of ng-apimock is now available through http://localhost:3000/mocking
